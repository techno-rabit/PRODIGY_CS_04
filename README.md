# SIMPLE KEYLOGGER

This Python-based keylogger captures and logs keystrokes for a specified duration, saving them to a file with a timestamp. It includes an ethical disclaimer, ensuring users understand the responsible use of the tool.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging**: Records all keys pressed and stores them in a log file.
- **Timestamp**: Each keystroke is logged with a timestamp for detailed tracking.
- **User Prompt**: Asks for the duration of logging and ensures acceptance of the disclaimer.
- **Ethical Usage**: Only runs after user agreement to terms of responsible and ethical usage.

## How It Works
### 1. Duration Input: Prompts the user to specify how long the logging should run.
### 2. Logging: Captures and logs key presses to a text file with timestamps.
### 3. Log File: Provides the path of the saved log file at the end of execution.
